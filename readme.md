Adds the ability to search through blogs into your WordPress Multisite installation.

## Note
This is a **major re-write** of Alicia Garc√≠a Holgado's original code and is therefore incompatible in many ways (including severely-limited language support).

If you need these features please support the original development of the plugin via the [Network page](https://github.com/tobyndockerill/multisite-global-search/network).

## Description

Easily search through all blogs into your WordPress Multisite by post title, post content or post
author.
Multisite Global Search doesn't work with single WordPress installation and it must be activated
for all sites using "network activate" in the Administration Panel.
Currently in the following languages:

* English
** Features **

* Multisite Global Search Widget. Show a search form in your sidebar.
* Search across all network blogs or only in your blogs if you are logged.
* Search on pages.
* Administrative choice to perform searches by default on pages.
* Administrative choice to disable search options.
* Search results are showed in a page which contents the shortcode: `[multisite_search_result]`
* Show excerpted results `[multisite_search_result excerpt="yes"]`
* Entries on every site across your installation appear in search results immediately after publication.
* Receive results from your complete blog network, even sites you do not own or control.
* Customizable style sheet for widget and results page.
* Two different form types, vertical and horizontal.
* Put search form into your code with `MultisiteGlobalSearch::ms_global_search_vertical_form(your_results_page)` or `MultisiteGlobalSearch::ms_global_search_horizontal_form(your_results_page)`
* Insert search form in templates using the shortcode: `[multisite_search_form]`. [See the plugin page for more information](http://grial.usal.es/agora/pfcgrial/multisite-search).

## Frequently Asked Questions

If you have any further questions, please submit them.

*Can the search form be used with a shortcode in templates versus the widget?*

Insert search form in templates using the shortcode: `[multisite_search_form]`

*How can show horizontal form using the shortcode?*

Use `type` attribute to select vertical form or horizontal form.
For example: `[multisite_search_form type="horizontal"]`
Default attribute value is `vertical`.

*How can change results page URI when you insert search form with the shortcode?*

Use `page` attribute to change results page URI.
For example: `[multisite_search_form page="multisite-search"]`.
Search results will be showed in http://your_blog_URL/multisite-search.
Default attribute value is `globalsearch`.

*Can I put search form into PHP files using a function?*

Yes. Using WordPress's `do_shortcode` function, you may reuse the existing shortcode functionality.

*Get error "check you have create views privilege in your WordPress database. Illegal mix of collations for operation 'UNION'".*

The instruction means that you may not have given the necessary priviledges to your MySQL user.
The user needs to be assigned the ability to "create views".

*Limit results to just the title and the excerpt*

Edit results page and place `[multisite_search_result excerpt="yes"]` in the post content area instead of `[multisite_search_result]`

*Set the plugin to always perform searches also in pages*

Check option "Search by default on pages" when you configure Multisite Global Search Widget.

If you use shortcode `[multisite_search_form]` use `search_on_pages` attribute to search by default on pages.
For example: `[multisite_search_form search_on_pages="1"]`.
Default attribute value is `0`.

*Customizing search form*

You may copy the CSS code from the stylesheet in the Multisite Global Search directory, paste it in your own stylesheet and modify it.
